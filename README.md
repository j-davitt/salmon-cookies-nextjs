# NEXT.JS

## Research Conducted By: Joe Davitt and Jordan Covington

## Overall Score and Comments

Score (Out of 10): 7

### General Comments

Full stack, I like that it will do endpoints and routing for you.

### Pros

- Felt just like React
- Routes endpoints for you.
- Global CSS didn't need to be imported.

### Cons

- Didn't feel like the built in components were user friendly.

### Ratings and Reviews

Documentation

> It didn't feel like we got the opportunity to really explore the full stack capabilities of Next.js with Salmon Cookies.

Systems Requirements
<!-- Above and beyond ‘node’ and ‘linux’, what dependencies or core requirements exist for this framework? Is it easily deployable to the cloud? Does it require a certain database? -->
> Core Requirement - React, React-DOM

Ramp-Up Projections
<!-- How long would/should it take a team of mid-junior developers to become productive? -->
> Should take a couple weeks if the team is familiar with React.

Community Support and Adoption levels

> Seems very popular based off job postings we have seen.

`npm run dev`

Endpoint: /SalesData
Returns a page with the sales data table.



## * Next.js documentation below *

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
